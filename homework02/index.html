        <p>
          HTML (from the English HyperText Markup Language - “ hypertext markup
          language”) is a standardized hypertext markup language for viewing web
          pages in a browser . Web browsers receive<br />
          an HTML document from the server via HTTP / HTTPS protocols or open it
          from a local disk, then interpret the code into an interface that will
          be displayed on the monitor screen.

          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML,
          constructs, images, and other objects, such as an interactive web form
          , can be embedded in the rendered page. HTML provides the means to
          create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other elements.
          HTML elements are distinguished by tags written using angle brackets.
          Tags such as "img" and "input" directly introduce content into the
          page. Other tags, such as, surround and style text within themselves,
          and may include other tags as subelements. Browsers do not render HTML
          tags, but use them to interpret page content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>XHTML</b> is a stricter version of HTML that follows the syntax of
          XML and is an application of XML to the hypertext markup area.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>JavaScript </b>can be embedded in HTML to control the behavior and
          content of web pages. Also, including CSS in HTML describes the look
          and layout of the page.

        <h2>General introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The HTML hypertext markup language was developed by British scientist
          Tim Berners-Lee around 1986-1991 at CERN in Geneva , Switzerland. HTML
          was created as a language for the exchange of scientific and technical
          documentation, suitable for use by people who are not specialists in
          the field of typesetting . HTML successfully dealt with the complexity
          of SGML by defining a small set of structural and semantic elements
          called descriptors. Descriptors are also often referred to as " tags
          ". With HTML, you can easily create a relatively simple yet
          beautifully designed document. In addition to simplifying document
          structure, support for hypertext has been added to HTML . Multimedia
          features were added later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first public description of HTML was the "HTML Tags" document,
          first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It
          describes the 18 elements that make up the initial, relatively simple
          HTML design. With the exception of the hyperlink tag, they are heavily
          influenced by SGMLguid, an internal documentation format based on the
          Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), at CERN. Eleven of these
          elements still exist in HTML 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, the HTML language was conceived and created as a means of
          structuring and formatting documents without being tied to the means
          of reproduction (display). Ideally, text with HTML markup should be
          reproduced without stylistic and structural distortions on equipment
          with various technical equipment (color screen of a modern computer,
          monochrome screen of an organizer, limited-sized screen of a mobile
          phone or device and programs for voice reproduction of texts).
          However, the modern use of HTML is very far from its original purpose.
          For example, tag "table" is designed to create tables in documents,
          but is sometimes used to design the placement of elements on a page.
          Over time, the core idea of ​​HTML's platform independence has been
          sacrificed to modern needs for multimedia and graphic design.
